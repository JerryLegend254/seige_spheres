##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Pygame library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JerryLegend254/seige_spheres.git
cd seige_spheres
```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
 - On Windows
   ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
 - on Mac/Linux
   ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the game:
```bash
python __main__.py
```

##  Gameplay Mechanics

### Scoring
- Score points by getting the ball into your opponent's goal
- The game continues until players decide to quit
- Current scores are displayed at the top of the screen

### Power-up System
- Power-ups spawn randomly every 10 seconds (70% spawn chance)
- Active power-ups are displayed next to the player's score
- Multiple power-ups can be active simultaneously
- Some power-ups stack with others for increased advantage

### Physics
- Ball speed increases slightly after each paddle hit
- Collision angles are calculated based on impact point
- Anti-stick mechanism prevents ball from getting trapped
- Minimum bounce angles ensure dynamic gameplay
